This repository contains the code to reproduce the results contained in the article [Scaling Bayesian Inference with PyMC3](https://medium.com/@fipinoch/scaling-bayesian-inference-with-pymc3-96c28ed3b728). The article shows a way to make PyMC3 faster by reducing the dimension of the problem and using weighted likelihoods. With the mentioned technique one can achieve constant runtime order.
